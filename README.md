## Problem Statement

Many healthcare centers, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, lack round-the-clock access to radiologists, leading to delays in interpreting medical scans, poor patient understanding of results, weak triage systems, late diagnosis, and overcrowding of higher-level hospitals.
